Uses a genetic algorithm to seek out an n-gram approximation of John Ashbery's "Whatever It Is, Wherever You Are"

Ashbery text available freely under copyright here https://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2847&context=iowareview and included as a convenience, please do not extract my transcription except for other fair use (I believe displaying n-gram approximation from a private corpus is fine, but is it legal to /read/ in its entirety here?
